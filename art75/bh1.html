<p>Hello, and welcome to the Life Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”). The Terms you see below are important because they:
<br>
Outline your legal rights on your identity in Life
Explain the rights you give to us when you follow what we say in Life
Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when in Life
Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration
Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully. We hope you’re sitting comfortably because this, just like all terms and conditions, we made incredibly boring and long in hopes that you will not actually read it. Here we go… </p>
<br>
<p>1 Introduction
	<br>
Thanks for choosing society led Life. Society led Life provides personalized services with interactive features for making important decisions and other life long commitments as well as other social services that may be developed from time to time. By using any of these Life services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Life Service” or “Life” itself), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the mainstream media that we will now feed to you from a young age, you are entering into a binding contract with Life Inc.
<br>
Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”). The Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court. If you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found nowhere because that's just life. You acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them. If you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use Life or access any Content including your Identity.
<br>
In order to use society led Life and access any Content, you need to (1) listen to us and follow any trends we create, (2) hold onto minimal amounts of individuality if any at all, and (3) pressure others to join society led Life and look down upon them if they do not conform. You also promise that any information that you submit to society led Life is what we want to hear, occasionally questionable, and completely mindless, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.</p>

<p>2 Changes to the Agreements
<br>
Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements. When we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with no notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying nothing within the Service and by sending no sign of how to follow up with these changes. In some cases, we will expect you to know about changes ahead of time, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes. Please therefore make sure you are always stressed and on high alert for peer disapproval. If you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by creating a more truthful and accepting version of yourself.</p>
<br>
<p>3 Enjoying Life
Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Life.
<br>
3.1 Service Options
<br>
You can find a description of our Service options in several high fashion or gossip magazines, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a society led Life account. Certain options are provided to you free-of-charge such as high levels of unnecessary stress and self doubt. The Life Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as “Societal Pressures.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Public Eye Figure Service”). We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through Life. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.
<br>
The Unlimited Service may not be available to all if not any. We will most definitely not explain which services are available to you when you are playing this game of life. If you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your mentality when aproaching others opinions and criticism towards your identity), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service. Note that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer have this Service.
<br>
If you have purchased or received any codes, life-hacks, or other offers provided or sold by or on behalf of society led Life for access to a Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions. You may also purchase access to a Subscription through a third party. In such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.
<br>
3.2 Trials
<br>
For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial. By providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO CONSTANTLY BE FEEDING INTO MAINSTREAM SOCIETAL CULTURE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SOCIETY LED LIFE.</p>
<br>
<p>4 Payments and Cancellations
	<br>
4.1 Billing
<br>
You may purchase a Paid Subscription to society led Life either by (1) paying multiple fashion, make up, possible plastic surgeon, diet fad, and more fees on a daily to monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed prior to the purchases; or (2) inherriting a well known reputation and privileges the majority of the public will not experience.
<br>
Life may change the payment specifications for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes will take effect immediately on the date of the price change and each individual will be expected to keep up with payments. Subject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use society led Life after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by not listening to what society wants you to do and who the general public thinks you should be.
<br>
4.2 Renewal; Cancellation
<br>
Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Life or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Life, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Mainstream Social Pressure Service. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.
<br>
If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service. If you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.
</p>
<br>
<p>5 Using our service
	<br>
Society Led Life and the Content are the property of over empowered political and pop-culture figures. We grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of Society Led Life, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”). This Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you. You promise and agree that you are using Society Led Life and Content for your own personal,  and possibly commercial use and that you will help redistribute and transfer the messages and Content of Society.
<br>
The Life software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Society and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of Life's software applications and Content even after installation in your "personal" life.
<br>
All Life trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Life brand (“Society Led Life”) are the sole property of Society or its licensors. The Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Life Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.
<br>
You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Society Led Life Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements. Except for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Life grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Social Service or Content.
<br>
Third party opinions (for example, the unique and supportive opinion of your weird aunt) included in the Life Service are made available to you under the expectation that you will not pay attention to this positive life advice and that instead you will continue to follow the path that society leads you down.</p>
<br>

<p>7 Entire Agreement
	<br>
Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Society, the Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Life and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.
<br>
Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Society Led Life Service may be governed by additional agreements. That could include, for example, access to certain jobs or career paths due to gender bias, free or discounted items depending on your race and ethnicity, or even basic human rights and your safety depending on how you identify and/or look. When you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will most likely not be presented with any related additional agreement. Some of those additional terms are listed absolutely nowhere becasue this is life. To the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms shall prevail. Basically, until you start to form your own identity without fear of society's expectations and standards, we here at Society Led Life create, develop, and own your identity.</p>
<br>
<p>8 Assignment
	<br>
Society Led Life may assign the Agreements, and any of its rights under the Agreements, in whole or in part, and Society may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements. You may not assign the Agreements, in whole or in part, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under the Agreements, to any third party.</p>
<br>

<p>Life Privacy Policy

<p>
1. Introduction
<br>
Thanks for choosing Society Led Life!
<br>
At Life, we want to give you the best possible experience to ensure that you enjoy our service today, tomorrow, and in the future. To do this we need to understand your different habits and interests so we can deliver an exceptional and personalized service specifically for you. That said, your security is, and will always be, enormously important to us. So, we want to transparently state to you how we here at life are partnering up with various governments, large corporations, and third parties in order to watch your every move and attempt to control the choices you think you have throughout this game of life.
<br>
That is our objective, and agreeing to this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) will be stripping you of any "personal" information you think you may have.
