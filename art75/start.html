	<h1>Welcome to life</h1>
	<p>Hi there! I am society. I will be helping you through this game. Unfortunately we seem to have lost the manual, but if you listen to my directions you will be very happy. To be happy in life you first have to find your identity. Without a manual, this might take a little while and it may be confusing but don't worry because I'm here to help you! </p>

	<p>Lets start with something easy! Are you a boy or a girl?</p>

	<a href="boy.html" class="buttons">Boy</a>

	<a href="girl.html" class="buttons">Girl</a>

	<a href="identity.html" id="hidden">I Don't Identify as Either</a>
